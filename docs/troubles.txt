1. Beaglebone resets STLink on attempts to use its virtual serial port
(aka virtual comport)

A device /dev/ttyACM0 appears in Beaglebone when the Nucleo board is connected
to the host USB port of Beaglebone:
   Beaglebone (host-USB) <--- USB cable ---> Nucleo (STM32F103RB, USB-powered)

But STLink is reset by host after configuring the STLink device (stty -F /dev/ttyACM0)
or sending bytes to it (with the default configuration of 9600 baud). It happens
around 30 seconds after any attempt or access.
The data transmission has been done from Beaglebone to the Nucleo board usually
using the shell 'echo' command:
$ echo "1" > /dev/ttyACM0

The Linux image 'Debian 9.9 2019-08-03 4GB SD IoT' has been downloaded from [1]
and installed in Beagleboned.

All attempts given below were failed:
- use udev rule in '/etc/udev/rules.d/49-stlinkv2-1.rules', which is provided in [2]
- re-configure the settings of '/dev/ttyACM0' using 'stty' [3]
- use of minicom (with 115200 baud, no HW flow control)
- apply external 5V supply directly to the Nucleo board as specified in [4]
- powering Beaglebone either by 5V plug or by the mini-USB port
